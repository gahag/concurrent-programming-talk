* Concurrency Talk
  This are the slides for my talk about concurrent programming in Rust.

  They can be visualized via either the PDF or the HTML file.
** How to make slides like this?
   The slides were built with [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]], [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal][org-re-reveal]] and [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]].

   The source code is composed of the =presentation.org= and =custom.css= files.
